  <p class="p"> Since the year 316 of the Laurentian Calendar, the Fishpeeker family has regularly 
assumed the role of Supermayor for the lake-covered Laurence country. Their triumph over
the demonic Crabs that once terrorized the people of these lands would have been enough to
make them royalty, but it was their devotion to kinship and cooperation that allowed their
young nation to prosper as it has for the past 151 years. By sharing their methods of hunting
the Crabs and harvesting their shells with their fellow Withered Peoples, lifespans that once
reached a meager 45 years have doubled. Within a generation, the Fishpeekers were able to create 
the first unified nation-state in over 2,000 years. 
</p>
<p class="p">
In its current state, the Fishpeeker Mayoralty has dominated all of the rivers that flow to
the great lakes. Each village in this sphere participates in an open flow of ideas and goods,
usually traveling along the lakeside from region to region in a manner reflecting the traditional
Laurentian Run. Beyond that, they have expanded as far as their current inertia has allowed.
To the north, their will extents to the arctic desolation. 
East, to the peoples of the oceanic coast with whom they occasionally trade. 
West, to the border with the tribalistic Dakotans along Lady Sipper's River. 
And South, to the periphery that borders the mysterious mountain lands of the Ancients. 
</p>
<p class="p">
Though the peoples of greater Laurentia practice different religions, they and many others
on the continent believe in the Lineage of the Rooster. It is said that once
every few generations, a single person will be chosen by their god to 
lead the nation into prosperity.
The Rooster can appear anywhere, so the actual identity of the current mantle-holder is often 
contested. In places where there is no definitive sighting of the chosen one, victory in battle 
is erroneously attributed to the spirit of The Rooster. Meanwhile, military or political defeat is 
explained away by a loss of heavenly favor. This 
<br><br>
All squables aside, the only people unanimously believed to be Roosters this side of the Great Divide
are as follows:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 10px; margin: 10px;">
<li>In the North: Supermayor of Laurentia, Sandy Fishpeeker I (151 years BP*) </li>
<li>In the West: Chieftan of the Dakotan Tribes, Brandy "Ono" Deadsnake (208 years BP)</li>
<li>In the South: King of Carolinia, Pearly Walker (1,200 years BP) </li>
<li>In the East: First Speaker of the Apalachicolan Thirds, Echo'o Denny (500 years BP)</li>
</ul>

<!-- some deets about how FP united the mayoralties around the lakes, and the
feudal-esque system they have. also how the southern periphery is just a buffer
against the appalachians because the mountain people are sp0oky. we're chill with
the atlantic federations since they have *bigger problems* to deal with, and 
these days the tribes of the west have chilled out so we've been able to assert
ourselves more down to the ohio (stopping in cairo, since rn we got hella bandits
(maybe funded by the eastern kingdoms?)along the southern mississippi until 
you get to the deltans) -->
